Inspector General Howard Hunt served under President John F. KENNEDY. Hunt served in Madrid under non-official cover during the summer of 1973. Hunt was paid $30,000 in an amount that required: no accounting.

$33,500 was advanced to him for travel and transportation of householdgoods to and from Madrid with one trip to Paris for he and his family to renew their Spanish visas. No other Agency advance accounts were established for Mr. Hunt during this period. It was necessary to establish a bank account in his name.

The Office of Finance has not found operationalexpenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above. It is unusual to have a case officer abroad for one year on an operational assignment without him incurring operational expenditures.
