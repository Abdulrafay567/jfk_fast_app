Draft Memorandum to the DCI from William Harvey Dated 27 November 1962. Plan provides for continuing, evenintensifying, the intelligence effort against Cuba.

CIA operations involving a high noise level and a distinct element of attributability will be unacceptable as a matter of policy. The U.S. assurances of no invasion and no support of an invasion will, in effect, constitute giving to Castro and his regime a certain degree of sanctuary. This will severely damage the morale and motivation of anti-regime Cubans.

As a matter of policy, political pressures and economic pressures against Cuba will be continued. paramilitary, commando and sabotage operations, except in rare selective instances, will serve little purpose. Increased use of facilities, real estate and basing outside the United States will be necessary.

Cuba should be targeted for maximum action to induce a split in the Cuban regime. Intelligence Exploitation of Refugees should be intensified. Relationships between Cuba, USSR, Red China, Latin American nations and other Free Worldand uncommitted nations should be studied.

Opa-Locks Interrogation Center as such was dismantled. Pan American Airways and KLM to reinstitute their regular flights from Havana to Miami.

We will continue to press the liaison services who are assisting us in the effort against Cuba for additional coverage. The services most effectively co-operating at this point in this connection are the British, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Norwegian, West German, Mexican, Argentinian, Uruguayan, Canadian, Chilean, and Israeli. Personal representation by you to the services underlined above would be useful.

The CIA will continue to press NSA for additional coverage of Cuban comunications. A complete survey has been made world-wide of all Communist Party penetration operations.

The two successful black infiltrated teams (COBRA and AMTORRID) will be continued, resupplied, and reinforced. The recruitment of Cubans who already are legally resident in Cuba will be used for intelligence collection purposes. As feasible, agents will be exfiltrated for training, indoctrination, supplying with communications, and motivation.

An intensive program will continue to take advantage of any possible opportunity to weaken, subvert, or split the regime in any possible fashion. The effectiveness of assets aimed at splitting the regime, 1.e., a palace revolt, will of course depend, to an extent, on the willingness of the United States Government to support them. No wide scale program is contemplated.

Current counterintelligence and counterespionage program against the Cuban G-2 andrelated services will be continued and as possible intensified. G. Political Action, Propaganda, Psychological Warfare: In this field the following tasks will be continue and where appropriate intensified.

We will continue the clandestine exploitation of exile groups for intelligencecollection, psychological warfare and other approved missions. We will act to mount as much of this effort espossible from areas outside the continental United States, and particularly from Latin America. It is believed that efforts should be made to transfer as much as possible. responsibility for this non-clandestine, non-intelligencetype operation into the political field, which is the province of the Department of State.
