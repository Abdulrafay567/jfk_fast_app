The writer met George Wackenhut, the president of the company, at his home in Coral Gables, Florida, on March 14, 1963. The writer also met Wes Reynolds, a former FBI agent, who represented the company.

Wackenhut states that it trades on the reputation of the FBI by publicizing widely the widely the ex-FBI agents in his management. The company has offices in Miami, Florida, Tampa, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Buffalo, Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose (Calif.), Honolulu, San Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico.

Wackenhut wants to expand abroad, in view of his successful venture into Puerto Rico. He has no definite definiteplans as of the present and seemed to be seeking from CIA covert 24sponsorship for entry into areas of interest to us. It is not apparent to me that there is any significant market for WackenhUT's services in foreign countries.

Wackenhut impressed me as a clean-cut, energetic, ambitious young business man. He is obviously proud of what appears to be                a superior organization of its type. He appears somewhat younger in person then in the pictures appearing in the promotional material given the writer.
