E. Howard Hunt met in the DCD Washington Field Office on 28 September 1974. Hunt asked if it was being tape-recorded; I assured him that it was not. Hunt said he did not care; but that, if it were to be recorded, he would like to know. Changes were agreed to in the items set forth in paragraphs 12, 14, and 25 of the CI Staff memorandum.

Hunt contended that most of these items should not be considered sensitive since they had been publicized extensively. He agreed to changes in the items referred to in paragraphs 1, 3, 17, and 32 of the CI Staff memorandum of 19 September.

Hunt showed me what was described as a "comfort letter" He said nothing in the manuscript violated any agreement between himself and the CIA, nor would subject him to prosecution under the espionage laws. Hunt seemed convinced that nothing in his book will harm our operations or personnel.
