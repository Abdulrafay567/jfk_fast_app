Herbert Itkin was a lawyer and confidant for the Haitian Government-In-Exile. He was also involved with the Mafia and labor unions. He tried to secure custody of his wife's children from her second marriage.

Itkin and his wife had for a long time been struggling to maintain custody over her children from her second marriage. Frederick Hersh, Mrs. Itkin's former husband, gained custody of the children by means of a ruling from the British court in 1966. The Federalauthorities eventually placed protection around Itkin and His wife, keeping them on a military reservation.

The thrust of the file is mainly defensive. CIA was reacting to Itkin's tactics to help his wife gain cus-                tody over her children. Itkin was part of an FBI attempt to gain information on the Mafia.
