JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON-2 evolved from a security action taken in September 1962 to insure that a security breach would not occur. The establishment of a working relationship with the Identity 3 was an objective which JMWAve had always hoped to obtain. The relationship was carefully cultivated in order that JMWaVE might be able to use this contact at the Ldentity 3 as a means of achieving its objective.

In mid-December 1962, all of JMWAVE's business with the Identity 3was handled via AMCARBON-2. In mid- December 1962, AMCARbon-2 suggested that he introduce REUTEMAN to AMCARPON-1. As a result of this initial meeting, an operational relationship has developed. This relationship contributes to the fulfillment of the over-all JMW aVE mission.

JMWAVE'S relationship with AMCARBON-1 lasted from December 1962 to March 1964. The two men worked together for the Identity 3, a news agency based in Florida. The Identity 3's policy was not to embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations.

QDELF: AMCARBON-1 is an extremely likeable fellow who has a keen mind but lacks experience in depth on Latin Americanaffairs. It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse of time, he will develop into one of the leading Latin American specialists in U.S. journalistic circles.

AMCARBON-l is used to carry out certain operational support tasks. It enables JMWAVE toharness the investigative facilities of the Identity 3. Several examples are outlined below.

In July 1963, an associate editor for the Saturday Evening Post was in Miami attempting to research a story regarding the possibility that strategic missiles were hidden in Cuban caves. This information enabled Headquarters to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles. In November 1963, AMCARBON-1 received a letter from Peru which contained an interesting operational lead to one Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Peru.

AMCARBON-1 has been used successfully as a propaganda outlet for KUBARK. The story on AMCRAB-1 was picked up by UPI, API and others and played throughout Latin America.

The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santiago, Chile, was not receiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida newspapers. A steering tip was given to AMCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in Key West interview Mr. Charles GRIFFIN. The story was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the identity 3.

Chile is one of five Latin countries which still maintains diplomatic relations with Cuba. President Salvador Allende lost by 35,000 votes to outgoing president Jorge Alessandri in 1958.

The Miami Herald is a leading newspaper in Miami, Florida. It is owned by the Cuban government. The Miami Herald was founded by Cuban exiles in the 1950s.
