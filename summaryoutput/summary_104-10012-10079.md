Australian Security Intelligence Organization. P. O. Box 51058B                Melbourne Dear Charles, Thank you for your letter of 15 October recommending against the declassification of Warren Commission document CD-071. There is not, at the present time, any intention to release CD-971. Should the question be raised at some future time, the points made by you in your letter provide every reason to keep the document out of the public domain. With kindest regards, Richard Helms.
