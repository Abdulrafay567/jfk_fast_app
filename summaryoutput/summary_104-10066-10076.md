Jim McCord was involved in an audio operation against the New China News Agency in Havana. The operation was aborted when it was due to be turned over to the Chinese Nationalist Embassy. McCord's role in the operation may never have been known.

The three technicians travelled to Cuba as tourists under very light commercial cover, two of them working for a company in New York and the third, one in Baltimore. The sub-lease for the apartment in which the men were caught is in the name of the stay-behind agent. It is unclear at present what story had been agreed upon by the technicians and station personnel.

The wives of the other two technicians have been told what has happened and are being contacted at least once daily by TSD staffers and their wives. A conference with the two wives was held in TSD'on 19 September to go over the whole situation and determine if there were any personal problems on which the Agency could be of help.

The subjects will be released in Havana or Mexico. 1 will prepare mission folders for flights from mestophobicprobeble ports of entry to Isolation and Andrews Air Forca Base, Distribution: 1 CI Stelf3 OS3- grotesque3-S/COG3-C/FE3- C/TSD. 3- c/wa/, 3 RI RICHARD I. SKINNER, C/ASD/DO/P.
