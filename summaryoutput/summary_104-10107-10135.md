Herbert Itkin returned to the CIA in 1969 after a confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January. It was concluded that additional information was required on Thomas L. Roberts and Robert Delson. Itkin requested the security files on these two individuals.

The facts in the attached chronology are subject to question since they are the result of (Roberts)' own explanation of his affiliation with Itkin. The most critical aspect would appear to be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of                (Roberts)' affiliation with CIA. With regard to (Robert Delson) there appear to have been two operational considerations, one having been a request to use him with Project DTPILLAR.

Roberts worked for a law firm in New York from 1949 to 1956. He then worked for the National Lawyers Guild from 1956 to 1967. In 1967, he met Itkin for the first time since the scandal.

Roberts took a leave of absence from the (firm ofRoberts, Greenbaum & Itkin) which was to last from 1 June 1961 through 31 May (1963) (Roberts) was to receive $100) per week from the firm while on the leave. FBI advised Roberts was still reporting to them in New York on July 25, 1961.
