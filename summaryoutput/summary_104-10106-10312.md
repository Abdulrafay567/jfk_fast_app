Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO was a Soviet KGB officer who defected in 1964. He was involuntarily confined in the U.S. by the Agency for approximately three years. He became a fully-fledged citizen in April 1974.

Two reports were sent to the DDCI summarizing the results of the NOSENKO case. One was prepared by the Office of.Security and the other by the FBI. Both reports conclude that NOSenKO was a bona fide defector. A draft.memorandum attached to this file, dated 21 October 1968 and prepared. by the CI Staff, raises questionregarding NosenKO's bona fides.
