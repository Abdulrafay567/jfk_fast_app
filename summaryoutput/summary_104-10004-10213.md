President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. The Warren Commission was formed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the assassination. The Commission's first meeting was with CIA and Department of State officials.

I stated that, in my opinion, the information provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter)substantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to CIA for checking as to their accuracy. I indicated that this could be done.
