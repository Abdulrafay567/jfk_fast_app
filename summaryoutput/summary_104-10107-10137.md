Thomas L. Roberts has been a CIA Staff Agent since 28 August 1961. He was assigned for Cover to the Radio Corporation of America 24/7 legal staff. He spent time in (West Africa) writing a monograph on West African legal problems. In November 1964 (Roberts) was assigned to cover for a grant from a foundation which wasblown in the MHDOWEL exposures.

There appears to be no record of (Roberts) having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or what his financial contribution was to the law firm of Itkin, Roberts and Greenbaum. The New York District Attorney may be considering prosecution against Roberts for having absconded with funds received from negligent cases.
