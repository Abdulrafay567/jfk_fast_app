Maj. Watlington arrived in Miami on 6 June 1962. Arrangements were made for a lengthy session on the subject of Agreed Activities. Opa Locka Refugee Referral Procedures were to be agreed upon.

Col. Kail would be the logical point of reference in Opa Locka through which the referral system could be managed. Lt. Col. Causes asked if we still retained an operational interest in Batista. If we did not ACSI was interested in using this individual in an infiltration operation.

Liaj. Watlington stated that LACSI had previously tried to harness the 24 capabilities of the Spanish, Uruguayan and Canadian diplomatic pouches. He said that at the present time ACSI was not in touch with any third country, diplomats.

Maj. Watlington asked JMWAVE to continue to assess, polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought were suitable W/T candidates. He also asked that JMWaVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time as Lt. Col. Causes retired.

ACSI representatives said they believed that, for the time being, it would be better to continue the system as at present. JENTONS' permanent arrival at the beginning of July 1962 was agreed to.
