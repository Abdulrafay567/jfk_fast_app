The CIA obtained a transcript of Oswald's stay in Finland in October 1959, including his contact with the Soviet Consulate there. It takes 25 minutes to drive from the airport to downtown Helsinki; by taxi, it would take no more than 5 minutes to reach the Soviet consulate. The Soviet consulate probably closed at 1300 hours local time on Saturdays in 1959. Passenger lists at the U.S. Consulate in Helsinki are retained for six months only and then destroyed.
