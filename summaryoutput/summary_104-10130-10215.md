A special meeting was convened to consider the problem.of the prospective visit of Subject's father to the Russian.Embassy to obtain a visa. It was determined that he should not be briefed in advance and that an army cover be provided.

Mrs. TARASOFF says that her oldest sister, Mrs.herry COMELLA knows of her CIA employment and the necessity not to divulge this information. Subject's husband is in Mexico under light state cover but had previously been stopped firmly as a contract employee of the Department of State.

It was agreed among the conferees that since the purposefullyfather of Subject was unwitting of Subject's CIA employment he would not be specially briefed on what to answer. It was agreed that not knowing the specific Department of Government he would have to consult his daughter. Subsequent to the meeting expedite credit checks on the Subject and her husband revealed no record.
