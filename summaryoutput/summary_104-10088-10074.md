The 201 system provides a method for. controlling and filing all pertinent information about a person. Only a rela-tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify. opening a 201 dossier. Material which is filed in the dossier includes but is not limited to: 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831)

All material in a 201 dossier will be filed in document date order. Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest should be incorporated into the official 201. Field index cards (held by some desks) and area desk cards may be retained in the 201.
