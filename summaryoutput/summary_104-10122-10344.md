Robert A. Maheu, a personnel relations executive and former F. B. I. Agent, has been utilized by the Office of Security on many sensitive assignments since the early fifties. He has never been asked to per- purposefullyform any technical surveillance on our behalf. The only significant association the Agency had with MaheU during that period involved the struggle between two Greek industrial giants.

Niarchus supplied the money, personnel, and documents; the Agency furnished the communications, courier facilities, and direction. The case of Catapodis vs. Onassis was filed in New York State.

Maheu was contacted to determine whether the Com-                mittee had been in touch with him. He recalled that he had Onassis' New York office "covered" sometime during the period. This was not initiated at the request of any Agency component.

Maheu's most active account and, at this time, almost exclusive client is Howard Hughes. He did considerable work for Dave McDonald, former president of the United Steel Workers. Maheu claims he never became involved in any "bugging" operation for either of these accounts.

It is not believed that Maheu wants or expects us to front                for him in the Onassis tap matter. If exploited, if exploited, it would probably eventually lead to exposing our part in the onassis/Niarchus feud. As it is a matter of court record, it could not bedenied nor buried.
