The Information Council of the Americas (INCA) of 620 Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, was recently opened as a source of foreign intelligence on the radio broadcasting industry in Latin America. The current program of INCA is primarily concerned with the dissemination of taped record-                ings of anti-Communist material, called Truth Tapes.

We expect to extract the appropriate information from the folders and to present the material in a series of 00-B reports. In the meantime, as soon as all of Mr. Butler's current correspondencehas been properly filed, we expect to present it. 5. Enclosures: Services Branch LLOYD A. RAY.
