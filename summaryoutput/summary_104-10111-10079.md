The day after her husband's arrest, 16 September 1960, Mrs. Christ said her husband suffered a "nervous" collapse. She was advised that her husband was Chief of the Audio Operations Branch, and that this branch carried out requests for the surreptitious installation of microphones and other listening devices.

Mrs. Christ was shown as much information as possible about Mr. Christ's career history. He was employed by a "cover" organization, "Vachats Associates" He was provided with alien documentation, such as a driver's license and a Social Security number. Mrs. Christ has gradually picked up additional information, mostly from newspaper articles.

Mrs. Christ spent some moneys through Kessler to her husband, prior to the severance of diplomatic relations. Kessler hired Dr. Colomer, a Cuban National, to serve as the technicians attorney. Kessler visited Washington, D.C. in May 1961 to consult with Agency officers on the conditions in the prisons.

Mrs. Christ has been verbally advised of the contents of the commages we have exchanged with the technicians. She knows that over 1000 pesos were left by Dr. Colomer with the Cubans. She also knows that we recently requested the Cuban lawyer to forward requested tax package.
