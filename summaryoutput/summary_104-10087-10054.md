The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific interest to the Operations Directorate. It also provides a means for identifying subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them. Only a relatively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify opening a 201 dossier.

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational component, in coordination with the Information Services Group. 201 dossiers should be opened only on the following categories: (1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational approval requests. (2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening. (3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.

A 201 dossier should be purged of duplicate material, including exact copy(s) of a document. Top Secret documents in the document should be downgraded for retention in the 201 dossier.

An inactive 201 dossier or an inactive volume of a large 201 dossier should be returned to Central Files under a Routing and Record Sheet with information shown below. A 201 dossier may be kept on permanent charge at the desk during any period of active interest. If the dossier is transferred to another desk, the desk officer must notify Central Files of the transfer.

The Automated Index Section (IP/AIS) will provide the identity of the subject of a 201 file. Requests for more than five names or numbers must be listed and sent by tube or courier. A 201 file may be authorized for cancellation by a Records Officer, after appropriate coordination.
