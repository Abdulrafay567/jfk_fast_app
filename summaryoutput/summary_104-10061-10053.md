Antonio RODRIGUEZ Echazabal was born in Cuba on 17 August 1913. He has a master's degree in agriculture, professedly has no religion but is a Mason. He lived in Haiti for about eighteen years prior to thecommencement of his diplomatic career. He was accused of complicity in the raid on the Haitian Government.

In November 1959, RODRIGUEZ went to Guatemala as Cuban Ambassado. There, he appears to have associated freely with pro-Communist groups. In late 1961, he apparently told an acquaintance that he was finished with politics and wanted to devote the rest of his life to agriculture. It appears that he left France on 31 January 1962 en route to Martinique.
